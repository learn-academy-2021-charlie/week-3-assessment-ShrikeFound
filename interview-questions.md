# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: this is a reserved word that represents the current context the program is working within. Inside of a class, this refers to the created instance of that class.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: yarn is a package manager; It handles the documentation of any packages our project requires and can take care of the installation when we ask it to.

  Researched answer:



3. What are props in React?

  Your answer: props are properties of a component that are passed in like we'd pass in a normal html tag's properties. These properties are part of a `props` object that the component can access.

4. What is JSX?

  Your answer: JSX is an extension to javascript that allows us to write HTML directly into our code. It is still javascript, it just lets us write code that is easier for us to understand.

  Researched answer:



5. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: any event that happens on the page, e.g. mouse clicks, mouse movement, page loading, keypresses, etc. We can create listeners for these events in javascript that then complete tasks for us. For example, we can listen for a keypress, and when a key is pressed we can perform some logic using javascript (like checking which key it is and running different functions depending on which key was pressed). Information about the event itself is passed as an object that we can access through these listeners.

6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: an anonymous function is a function without a name. Because it doesn't have a name, we can't call this function directly, so we often use them inside of other functions or listeners that we can depend on.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: rendering a component only if certain conditions are met. For example, we could render a welcome message component only if a user is signed in.

2. Ruby: Ruby is a dynamic language that is super fun.

3. Object oriented programming: OOP is a model for programming that focuses on using classes and objects to focus on data as individual objects that can be manipulated. This lets us split our applications up into distinct components are modular and reusable.

4. Ruby hash: hashes in ruby are similar to objects in javascript, with some differences (like hashes not accepting methods as values)

5. Ruby blocks: ruby blocks are ~~magic~~ anonymous functions, and are used similarly to how anonymous functions are used in javascript methods like .map() or for loops.
